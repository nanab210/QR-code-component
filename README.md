### Built with

### What I learned

I've been focusing on FlexBox learning and think this was a nice challenge to practice it.

```css
.container {
  max-width: 680px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin-top: 50px;
}
```

### Continued development

I will focus practicing FlexBox and CSS grid as I still find these a challenge.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand FlexBox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Example resource 2](https://coolors.co/image-picker) - This tool I use to extract pallete colors from images. An alternative for those who don't have adobe premium.
